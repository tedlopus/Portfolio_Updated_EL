# Portfolio_Updated_EL
An updated and more professional version of my portfolio page

## Description
This application is an updated portfolio that further developed my original portfolio. I built developed this using bootstrap which helped make the design of the flex boxes more fluid than without it. I used a different coloring style to help make the application not create eye-strain. I wanted this portfolio to seem more personalized so I added the cover photo of the mountains. I updated the deployed application links to be cards and not just pictures with a heading not attached to the picture. There is a downloadable link to my resume as well as my updated linkedIn and GitHub profiles.

Open the portfolio by opening the html through with your default browser. You will then be brought to my portfolio page.
